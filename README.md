# üèê Rule-Based Beach Volleyball Booking System

*Complete development guide for building a production-ready booking system with rule-based flexibility*

## üìã Quick Navigation

- **üöÄ [Quick Start (2 hours)](QUICK-START.md)** - Rapid prototype for testing concepts
- **‚öôÔ∏è [Configuration Guide](CONFIGURATION.md)** - Business rules and examples
- **üìñ Complete Guide** - This document (architecture + implementation + timeline)

## ‚úÖ Plan Feasibility Assessment

### **Overall: SOLID with Timeline Adjustments Needed** ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Strengths:**
- ‚úÖ Excellent technology choices (Supabase + Next.js + Stripe)
- ‚úÖ Innovative hybrid approach (pre-generated slots + rule flexibility)
- ‚úÖ Smart payment-first model eliminates no-shows
- ‚úÖ Proper security foundation with RLS policies
- ‚úÖ Can easily handle 50-500+ bookings/month

**Recommended Timeline Adjustments:**
- **Original**: 22 days ‚Üí **Recommended**: 25 days
- **Add 3 buffer days** for real-world complexity
- **Simplify V1 admin interface** (enhance post-launch)
- **Test critical paths early** (Stripe webhooks, pg_cron)

**Cost Projections Look Good:**
- ‚Ç¨85-105/month for 500 bookings is competitive
- Technology choices support these projections

## üéØ System Overview

### What This System Does
- **Rule-Based Slot Management**: Generate booking slots automatically based on configurable business rules
- **Staggered Court Scheduling**: Handle facility constraints (Court A at :00, Court B at :30)
- **Payment-First Booking**: Eliminate no-shows with Stripe payment integration
- **Admin Self-Service**: Venue owners modify pricing/availability without developer involvement
- **Real-Time Updates**: Live slot availability with Supabase real-time

### Key Innovation: Hybrid Approach
Unlike purely static (pre-generated) or dynamic (calculated on-demand) systems, this hybrid approach:
- ‚úÖ **Fast Performance**: Pre-generated slots with database indexes
- ‚úÖ **Rule Flexibility**: JSON-based business configuration
- ‚úÖ **Auto-Maintenance**: Cron jobs handle slot generation and cleanup
- ‚úÖ **Conflict Prevention**: Database constraints prevent double bookings
- ‚úÖ **Instant Rule Changes**: Updates take effect immediately

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth + Real-time + Edge Functions)
- **Payments**: Stripe (Payment Intents + Webhooks)
- **Automation**: pg_cron for scheduled tasks
- **Monitoring**: Built-in Supabase + custom health checks

### Expected Performance & Costs
- **Performance**: <500ms API responses, <2s page loads, >99.5% uptime
- **Scalability**: 50-500+ bookings/month without architecture changes
- **Monthly Costs**: ‚Ç¨85-105 for 500 bookings/month (Supabase + Stripe + hosting)

## üó∫ Database Schema

### Core Tables

```sql
-- Enable necessary extensions
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "uuid-ossp";
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "pg_cron";

-- Business Rules Table (Core of Rule System)
CREATE TABLE business_rules (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    rule_type TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (rule_type IN ('operating_hours', 'pricing', 'court_config', 'slot_generation')),
    rule_key TEXT NOT NULL,
    rule_value JSONB NOT NULL,
    
    -- Versioning and lifecycle
    version INTEGER DEFAULT 1,
    effective_from DATE DEFAULT CURRENT_DATE,
    effective_until DATE,
    
    -- Metadata
    created_by UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
    
    -- Ensure unique active rules
    UNIQUE(rule_type, rule_key, effective_from) WHERE is_active = TRUE
);

-- Available Slots Table (Core of Hybrid Approach)
CREATE TABLE available_slots (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    
    -- Slot identification
    court_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    slot_date DATE NOT NULL,
    start_time TIME NOT NULL,
    end_time TIME NOT NULL,
    start_datetime TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE GENERATED ALWAYS AS (
        (slot_date + start_time) AT TIME ZONE 'Europe/Tallinn'
    ) STORED,
    end_datetime TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE GENERATED ALWAYS AS (
        (slot_date + end_time) AT TIME ZONE 'Europe/Tallinn'
    ) STORED,
    
    -- Pricing and availability
    base_price_cents INTEGER NOT NULL,
    current_price_cents INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT base_price_cents,
    is_available BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
    
    -- Rule traceability
    generated_from_rules JSONB NOT NULL,
    pricing_rule_id UUID REFERENCES business_rules(id),
    
    -- Metadata
    generated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    last_updated TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    
    -- Prevent overlapping slots
    CONSTRAINT no_overlapping_slots EXCLUDE USING gist (
        court_name WITH =,
        tstzrange(start_datetime, end_datetime) WITH &&
    )
);

-- Enhanced Bookings Table
CREATE TABLE bookings (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    slot_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES available_slots(id) ON DELETE RESTRICT,
    
    -- Customer information
    customer_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    customer_email TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (customer_email ~* '^[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\\.[A-Za-z]{2,}$'),
    customer_phone TEXT NOT NULL,
    
    -- Payment information
    stripe_payment_intent_id TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    stripe_payment_status TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'requires_payment_method',
    amount_paid_cents INTEGER NOT NULL,
    
    -- Booking metadata

    cancelled_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
    
    -- Prevent double booking
    CONSTRAINT unique_confirmed_slot UNIQUE(slot_id) WHERE status IN ('confirmed', 'completed')
);
```

### Row Level Security

```sql
-- Enable RLS on all tables
ALTER TABLE business_rules ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE available_slots ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE bookings ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Public can read available slots and active business rules
CREATE POLICY "Public can read available slots"
ON available_slots FOR SELECT
TO public
USING (
    is_available = TRUE 
    AND slot_date >= CURRENT_DATE
);

CREATE POLICY "Public can read active business rules"
ON business_rules FOR SELECT
TO public
USING (is_active = TRUE AND (effective_until IS NULL OR effective_until >= CURRENT_DATE));

-- Service role has full access for Edge Functions
CREATE POLICY "Service role full access slots" ON available_slots
FOR ALL TO service_role USING (TRUE);

CREATE POLICY "Service role full access bookings" ON bookings
FOR ALL TO service_role USING (TRUE);
```

### Performance Indexes

```sql
-- Critical indexes for query performance
CREATE INDEX idx_available_slots_court_date ON available_slots(court_name, slot_date) 
WHERE is_available = TRUE;

CREATE INDEX idx_available_slots_datetime ON available_slots USING gist(
    tstzrange(start_datetime, end_datetime)
);

CREATE INDEX idx_bookings_slot_status ON bookings(slot_id, status) 
WHERE status IN ('confirmed', 'completed');

CREATE INDEX idx_business_rules_lookup ON business_rules(rule_type, rule_key, is_active)
WHERE is_active = TRUE;
```

## üîí Security & Best Practices

### Security Checklist

1. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - ‚úÖ Use Supabase Auth for admin users
   - ‚úÖ Implement proper RLS policies
   - ‚úÖ Validate JWT tokens in Edge Functions
   - ‚úÖ Use service role key only in Edge Functions

2. **Input Validation**
   - ‚úÖ Validate all user inputs with schemas (Zod)
   - ‚úÖ Sanitize email addresses and phone numbers
   - ‚úÖ Check business rule JSON schemas
   - ‚úÖ Validate date ranges and time formats

3. **Payment Security**
   - ‚úÖ Use Stripe Payment Intents (PCI compliant)
   - ‚úÖ Validate webhook signatures
   - ‚úÖ Never store card details
   - ‚úÖ Log all payment attempts

4. **Database Security**
   - ‚úÖ Enable RLS on all tables
   - ‚úÖ Use parameterized queries
   - ‚úÖ Limit database permissions
   - ‚úÖ Regular security audits

### Error Handling Pattern

```typescript
// Standardized error handling
class BookingError extends Error {
  constructor(
    message: string,
    public code: string,
    public statusCode: number = 500
  ) {
    super(message);
    this.name = 'BookingError';
  }
}

// Usage in Edge Functions
try {
  // ... business logic
} catch (error) {
  if (error instanceof BookingError) {
    return new Response(
      JSON.stringify({ 
        error: error.message,
        code: error.code 
      }),
      { 
        status: error.statusCode,
        headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" }
      }
    );
  }
  
  // Log unexpected errors
  console.error('Unexpected error:', error);
  
  return new Response(
    JSON.stringify({ 
      error: 'Internal server error',
      code: 'INTERNAL_ERROR'
    }),
    { 
      status: 500,
      headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" }
    }
  );
}
```
